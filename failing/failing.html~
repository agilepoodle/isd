# Single-loop learning

## Small failure - little rework eg. build failed
## Medium failure - significant rework eg. incorrect modeling

???

# S - Use few moments to reflect how to avoid these in the future
# M - Use more time to find out the root cause
# Mechanical fixing, automation, processes

# Double-loop learning

## Large failure - major rework eg. production bug

???

# Must allocate sufficient time for root cause analysis
# Should result in change of processes/thinking/analysis/modus operandi
# Retrospectives
