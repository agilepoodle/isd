# Change the connotation!

## Empower failure!

# The word has negative baggage
# Powerful, blaming word
# Embrace failure!
# See it in positive light!
# Teach others to see failure in different light
# Requires courage and determination
# Hard in project-oriented environment

# Single-loop learning

## Not _evaluating_ the cause

???

# Repeat without changing your way of working
# No variation of methods
# No questioning of the goal2

# Double-loop learning

## Change the mental model!

???

# Should result in change of
* processes
* thinking
* goals
* analysis
* modus operandi - way of working

# Tools: Retrospectives, reframing the problem differently

# Some heuristics

## Failure size?
## # of occurrences

???

# Small failure - little rework eg. build failed
# Medium failure - significant rework eg. incorrect modeling
# Large failure - major rework, losses, eg. production bug
# S & M, quick fixes with single-loop-learning
# S & M: Mechanical fixing, automation, processes
# L: Use more time to find out the root cause
# Has happened before? Change something!

# To fail is to learn!
