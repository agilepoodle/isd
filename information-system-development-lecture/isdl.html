# What is software about?

class: center, middle, title, people

# People

# People

???

### At least 50% about people
### Software is for humans, programming is something you do alone! 
### Users, customers, business owners, developers etc.
### Communication issue, Wiio's laws
### When communication fails, you build the wrong thing!
### What to do? Who benefits? Why? We need these answers!
### Purpose, Autonomy, Mastery (Daniel Pink)

class: center, middle, title, validate

# Validate your hypothesis

???

### Don't write software in vain!
### Validate your business idea - Why is software needed?
### If it is not needed, don't do it! 
### Good methods: Biz model canvas, value proposition canvas,
### Service design - design sprints
### Deliver to production!
### What is the best way to validate software? -> delivery to real users
### No software survives the first contact with the

class: center, middle, title, stream

# Value Stream
# Cycle/Lead time

???

### Concentrate on value, remove waste - especially in large projects
### Question everything, is it really needed?
### Measure the time from an idea to production (whatever production means) - Make it shorter!
### Software has 4 types of value: create new value, maintain existing value, prevent value loss, recover from value loss

# The Only reliable metric is ?

class: center, middle, title, computer

# The Only reliable metric is delivered software

???

### Metrics in software: When we are ready? When the product is ready? Quality? 
### Use history to forecast into the future
### Delivery early, deliver often
### Delivered software creates a validation loop!
### If it is not delivered, it's inventory
### Real life usage can be used to validate the product
### Deliver to test env if prod not possible!
### Practice delivery!

class: center, title, middle, problem

# Software is Problem solving

???

### Not programming!
### Solution oriented!
### Best software is not written
### Solve next problem, then next, ...

---

class: center, title, middle, simple

# Simple is not easy.

???

### No over-engineering, use the most simple solution available
### Do not make it more complex than needed "just in case", you won't need it in the future
### Simple architecture is extendable and modifiable

class: center, title, middle, simple

# "Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But itâ€™s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains." - Steve Jobs

class: center, title, middle, complexity

# Avoid complexity

???

### Added complexity sneaks in!
### Do absolute minimum that suffices
### Added complexity accrues cost!
### Complex is hard to change

---

class: center, title, middle, money

# Total cost ownership

???

### 20/80 rule, 20% of features bring 80% of value
### Affects decisions during development
### Short-lived product vs long-lived
### All decisions must be done with TCO in mind!

---

class: center, middle, title, fortress

# Reliability
# Robustness
# Security

???

### Extra care needed with large systems
### Can prevent usage
### Must be included in design and architecture from early on
### Cannot be attached 'after the fact' - or very costly

---

class: center, middle, title, tests

# Capacity

???

### WIP limits
### Hard prioritization
### Explicit work backlog
### Helps predicting/forecasting
---

class: center, middle, title, practice

# Practices
## Architecture decision log
## Test code is production code
## Pairing (mob programming)

???

### Treat tests as production code (maintenance)
