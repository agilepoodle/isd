# Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective, and may be viewed as the opposite of success.

???

# Let's contemplate  what failing is

---

class: center, middle, title, borked

# To fail or not to fail?

## Please fail.

???

# What has happened if we *DON'T* fail ?
# What do you categorize as a failure?
# Who has failed recently? What kind of failure?
# Dangerous not to fail because we learn from mistakes

# Change the connotation!

## Empower & embrace failure!

???

## The word Failure  has negative baggage
## Powerful, blaming word
## View  it in positive light!
## Failures are not a measure of self-worth
## Teach also others to see failure in different light
## This requires courage and determination
### Which is hard in a success-oriented environment

# What to do?

???

# Ask for help
# Two methods of learning
---

class: center, title, middle, single

# Single-loop learning

## Not _evaluating_ the cause

???

# Try again without changing rules, plans, values, goals, environment
# No variation of methods
# No questioning of the goal!

---

class: center, title, middle, loop

# Double-loop learning

## Change the mental model!

???

## Should result in new 
### processes
### thinking
### goals
### different goals
### deep analysis
### change in modus operandi - way of working
## Tools:
### Retrospectives
### Reframing the problem
#### Question the question
#### List env assumptions - then do the opposite 
#### Brainstorm bad ideas
### Change in your ways of working

# Reality

???

## S/M/L size heuristic
### S - possible to fix with single loop learning (automation, tooling)
### M - it depends (single-loop, eg. new rules like  build chain tools, static analysis)
### M - maybe pair programming, pair reviews, PR process
### L - must use double-loop learning, usually requires changes in the way we work
